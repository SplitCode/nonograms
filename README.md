# nonograms

Nonograms is a puzzle game to reveal a hidden picture by looking at the number clues. The blues are given at the top and left side of the grid. Each number in these include defines a block of black cell. A number indicates an unbroken line of black cells, and they are in the same order as the lines. These puzzles are often black and white—describing a binary image—but they can also be colored.
